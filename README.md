# Query Parser

This project implements a context aware parser that extracts structured information from unstructured queries. It handles synonyms, misspellings, and extracts product types, features, price ranges, locations and intended spaces.

## Features

- Extracts product type (sofa,chair, table, etc.)
- Identifies product features categorized by Back, Upholstery, Legs, Structure, etc.
- Parses price ranges with support for different formats and currencies
- Handles spelling errors and synonyms
- Extract location information
- Identifies intended space/room

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.6+
- Dependencies: fuzzywuzzy

## Setup

1. Clone this repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Aditya15267/furniture-query-parser.git
    cd furniture-query-parse
    ```

2. Install the dependencies
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Approach

The parser uses a hybrid approach combining:

1. **Regular expressions** for price extraction and pattern matching
2. **Fuzzy matching** for handling misspellings and variations 
3. **Synonym dictionaries** for normalizing terms
4. **Rule-based extractions** for identifying product types and features

## Key Components

- **Product Type Identification:** Matches against a dictionary of furniture types and their synonyms
- **Feature Extraction:** Categories features into Back, Upholstery, Legs, Structure, etc.
- **Spelling Correction:** Uses fuzzy matching and common misspelling dictionary
- **Location Extraction:** Identifies city names in the query
- **Space Identification:** Detects intended space/room (Living room, bedroom, etc.)

## Design Notes

The query parser is designed to be modular, interpretable, and easily extensible. Below are the key design considerations:

### Modular Architecture

The project is structured into separate modules for:

- **Product & Feature Matching:** Uses fuzzy matching and rule-based logic to extract product type and feature categories.
- **Price Parsing:** Extracts price ranges using regex patterns and currency normalization.
- **Location & Space Detection:** Identifies geographic and spatial intent from queries.

Each module is independently testable and replaceable.

### Hybrid NLP Approach

We combine multiple NLP strategies:

- **Fuzzy Matching (fuzzywuzzy):** To handle typos like "leathr" -> "leather".
- **Custom Synonym Dictionary:** Maintains mappings like "curvy" -> "Curved Back".
- **Rule-Based Logic:** It understands user requests by following set patterns, like identifying price ranges (e.g. detecting phrases like "under â‚¹30k").

### Domain Awareness

The system uses specific furniture vocabularies such as:

- Product types (Sofa, Chair, Ottoman, etc.)
- Feature categories (Back, Upholstery, Legs, etc.)
- Real-world price expressions (e.g. "under 30k", "between 20,000 and 50,000 INR")

By focusing on a specific area, it fills in the blanks precisely, without the errors of broader language.

## Testing

Run the test suite to verify parser functionality:

```py
python test_parser.py
```

The test suite includes diverse examples covering different product types, features, price formats, and handling of misspellings and synonyms.
